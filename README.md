This repo contains the Business Central app Seminar Registration which we used for our DOK Nordic 2024 sessions _Tip & Tricks for efficient and effective test automation data setup_ and Get better code by combining Test Plan & SOLID principles making your test automation lightning fast_. The app is part of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central training called _AL Solution Development_. It was trasferred from C/AL to AL by Luc van Vugt, but never published by Microsoft.
