This repo contains the Business Central app Seminar Registration which we used for our DOK Nordic 2024 sessions _Tip & Tricks for efficient and effective test automation data setup_ and _Get better code by combining Test Plan & SOLID principles making your test automation lightning fast_ by Christoffer ANdersen and Luc van Vugt.
The app is part of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central training called _AL Solution Development_. It was transferred from C/AL to AL by Luc van Vugt, but never published by Microsoft.
